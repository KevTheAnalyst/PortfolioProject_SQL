# COVID-19 Global Data Cleaning & Analysis (SQL)

A SQL project that cleans, transforms, and analyzes a large global COVID-19 dataset to generate actionable insights on infections, deaths, and vaccinations.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This is my **first major SQL project using a large real-world dataset**. I performed extensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a global COVID-19 dataset covering:

- infection and death counts  
- vaccination totals  
- population data

The objective was to **ensure data quality**, derive key pandemic metrics, and prepare structured results ready for visualization or further analysis.

## 🛠 Key Skills & Techniques

This project demonstrates strong proficiency in:

- **SQL Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
  Handling missing and blank values, standardizing dates stored as text, and ensuring consistent data quality.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Calculating metrics such as death percentages, population-scaled case rates, and identifying high-impact countries and continents.

- **Advanced SQL Queries**  
  Using **joins** to combine vaccination and case tables, **window functions** for cumulative totals, and **aggregations** for time-series summaries.

- **Creating Views for Reporting**  
  Building views to support downstream visualization and reporting tasks.
